This is a test post.  I don't really have all that much to say.  Blabity blabity blabity.  Test test test.  What else is new?  Bla bla bla.  I really don't have anything to talk about.  I need to make this into a full paragraph for styling purposes.  Once upon a time there was a man named Bob.  Bob really liked to eat chicken.  Fried chicken, baked chicken, you name it chicken.  Bob was a chicken type of guy.

Here is another paragraph.  We should talk about some ruby code:

{% highlight ruby %}
  def hi
    5.times do
      puts "bam!"
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}

Woo wasn't that fun?
