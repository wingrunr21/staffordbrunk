title: Switching to zsh
categories: [development]
---
I've been using <tt>bash</tt> for a long time.  I've certainly heard about alternate shells like <tt>zsh</tt>, but <tt>bash</tt> was doing everything I needed on a daily basis.  I already had my [dotfiles](http://www.github.com/wingrunr21/dotfiles) set up for my most common bash tasks.  I figured that with the handful of aliases that I had defined, as well as full TAB completion, there was most likely only a few areas where I could improve.

Last summer I made the switch from TextMate to VIM.  The increase in productivity surprised me and it has caused me to begin to notice other areas where I could use a bump.  One such area is on the command line.  I noticed quickly that I spend a lot of time typing full directory paths (with appropriate TAB completions in the process) or full git commands.  In fact, the only git commands of whose alias I used on a regular basis were <tt>git status</tt> (<tt>gs</tt>) and <tt>git diff</tt> (<tt>gd</tt>).

Today I spent the day switching my default shell over to <tt>zsh</tt>.  I downloaded and setup <tt>oh-my-zsh</tt>, migrated over some of my aliases, and settled in for the long haul.  You can see the new dotfiles in my [dotfiles](http://www.github.com/wingrunr21/dotfiles) repo.
